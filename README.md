https://opensource.com/article/20/1/object-tracking-camera-raspberry-pi - good article I found, closest article I could find to what we are trying to accomplish. From reading this article, I actually now don't think we need to BUILD OUR OWN deep learning model that tracks the person speaking Instead, we can use and object-detection model (like MobileNetV3-SSD) to do the person tracking for us, and then edit it to our needs.
